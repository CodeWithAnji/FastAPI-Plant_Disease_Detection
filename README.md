# ðŸŒ± Plant Disease Detection Web App

A **web application** to detect plant diseases from leaf images using a pre-trained **Keras model**. The backend is built with **FastAPI** and the frontend uses **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**. Users can upload leaf images and get real-time disease predictions.


## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload plant leaf images and predict diseases.
- Built with **FastAPI** for fast, asynchronous backend.
- Simple and responsive frontend with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- Displays predicted disease with a clean user interface.
- Supports multiple disease classes (customizable based on model).
